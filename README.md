# The Zwicker Tone
The purpose of this repository is to outline how stimuli which exhibit the Zwicker tone may be created. 

Currently the notebook outlines how to create several variations of stimulus exhibiting the Zwicker tone including:
- The monaural Zwicker tone.
- Alternating silence Zwicker tone.
- The binaural Zwicker tone.

It is planned to produce a web app which will allow for real-time creation of stimli.
